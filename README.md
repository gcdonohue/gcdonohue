- 👋 Hi, I’m @gcdonohue
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics for education, including LMS data, using marketing data to make assumptions about learner demographics and participation,
and learning how to code to better interpret data on progress and participation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Data Scientist career path from Codecademy, Python at the moment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me improve my ability to write dynamic code for analyzing data.
